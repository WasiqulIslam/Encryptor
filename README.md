# Encryptor v1.4

This program is used to modify a file (encrypt a file) so that no one can read it.
To run it simply download the "Encryptor.zip" zip file and extract and run (this works in Windows only). No setup is required for this.

Type file paths and Type character codes
and click ENCRYPT or DECRYPT Button to perform file operation.
If you encrypt a file with a code you can retrieve original file by
decrypting it with only the previously applied code used for encryption.

A simple example:
Click RESET.
Click the left blue '?' marked button.
Select any file
(do not select important file yet, as you are practicing).
Then type a password or code at the code text field.
Click ENCRYPT button.
At this step your file is encrypted.
Just click the DECRYPT button again to decrypt the file to
retain to its original contents.
This is a simple example but
you can change the path of 'Write to' text field to another file
for keeping the source file unchanged(specially for safety, but requires much space).


Warning:
Do not encrypt a file more than once.
Always make sure that you DO NOT FORGET THE CODE.

Note:
Encrypt a file with your secret code to make it unreadable
and when you want to read that file decrypt it with the same code to make it readable.
You can use this program to any kind of file such as text file, execution file etc.
This program processes only one file at a time so
if you want to encrypt several files at a time convert them into a single file
(for example making all the files as a zip file etc.)and encrypt that single file.
This program takes about 2 to 3 minutes to process a file of 500 MB length.
Note that you cannot change a file which is set to 'Read-Only' mode by the operating system.
Uncheck the 'Read-only' attribute before proceeding.


Extra Notes(for advanced users only):
Encrypt operation with a code is total inverse of
Decrypt operation with the same code,
so if you find any problem such as 'you encrypted twice' etc.
try doing the inverse operation the same number of time in inverse sequence.


Advanced code:
You can also enter code as ASCII integer values by pressing ENTER
when the focus is on the code text field.
Enter as many integers as you want but
make sure to write it down sequentially or remember its sequence.

Note that this is a basic encryption technique and hackers might be able to decrypt it if your code is not long enough.
